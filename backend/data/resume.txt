UNIVERSITY PROJECTS	


Sentiment Analysis Dashboard	Jan 2025 - April 2025 
Developed a real-time analytics dashboard using FastAPI and Hugging Face Transformers; deployed using Docker on AWS. Visualized data with Chart.js. Integrated Redis as a caching layer (proof of concept). Added Prometheus for basic performance metrics
Fine-tuned transformer-based NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa) on YouTube comment data for public sentiment classification; achieved an F1 score of 83.7 on the validation set.
Integrated model inference into a FastAPI backend and visualized sentiment trends via Chart.js and custom dashboards.
Explored prompt-based text summarization and laid groundwork for RAG-style retrieval using FAISS (prototype stage).

Safari Game project	Feb 2025
Developed and tested a safari simulation game using Python: Pygame and Pytest in a team of 4 members.
Collaborated using GitLab for version control and task coordination.


Scalable Data Systems	
Designed and deployed a real-time sentiment analysis system using FastAPI, Docker, and AWS, capable of handling thousands of requests with NLP model inference and trend visualization.
Optimized backend logic for scalable microservice performance using asynchronous Python and REST principles.
Currently exploring batch/stream processing with Kafka and distributed task queues (Celery, RabbitMQ) for personal projects.
